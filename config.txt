#This is a config file for the System Profiler Parsing Toolchain
#The left column contains field names, the right contains
#our specialized form of xpath expressions, which support
#spaces, escaped slashes, and parens

#Note: We do not list 'serial' or 'location' here because they are special cases
#Values for these will generally be overwritten.

# SPECIAL CASES
####################
####################
#
# In the xpath expressions below, the following special cases
# need different handling from what might be intuitive.
#
# Inside of brackets, node names will not be as specified elsewhere.
# They will be cleaned for xml, which means that non-alphanumerics will be
# replaced, and the strings prefixed with a single underscore. To get access
# to the original name, you should access the @name attribute, which
# contains the original name, with only &, <, and " replaced with
# underscores. (These are illegal characters for xml attributes).
#
# When entering a slash as part of a node name, escape the slash with a
# single backslash. For example, write //Graphics\/Displays/* to select
# all children of the node with name "Graphics/Displays". As mentioned
# above, the name will of course be cleaned.
#
# At present, we do not support node names containing backslashes.

#We need to handle 'Number of Processors' and 'Number Of Processors'
